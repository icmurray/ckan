Introduction
===========

Development
-----------

CKAN is an open source project and contributions are welcome! 

We discuss large changes and new features on the ckan-discuss list: http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-discuss

New developers should acquaint themselves with the documentation (see below). 

Proposed changes should be made on a personal CKAN fork (on BitBucket for example), then merges should be requested with the mainline via the ckan-discuss list.

We have policies for check-ins that ensure the build doesn't break etc. on http://ckan.org/#ProjectProcessesandPolicies which should be followed unless someone builds consensus to change it.
