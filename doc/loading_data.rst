Import Datasets
===============

If you have many datasets to add to CKAN, there are various ways to automate the process. 

* **Loader scripts**. We provide standard loading scripts for data. 
* **CKAN API**. You can use the CKAN API to upload datasets. See :doc:`api`.
* **Harvester extension**. The harvester extension is useful for loading datasets that need to be scraped (found at https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckanext-harvest/).

The most appropriate method will depend on the nature of your datasets. Hence, rather than attempting to provide detailed documentation, here, we recommend you `contact the ckan-dev mailing list <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-dev>`_ for advice.
