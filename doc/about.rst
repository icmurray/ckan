About CKAN
===========

Development
-----------

CKAN is an open source project and contributions are welcome! 

We discuss large changes and new features on the `ckan-discuss mailing list <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-discuss>`_.

Proposed changes should be made on a personal CKAN fork (e.g. on BitBucket), then merges should be requested with the mainline via the ckan-discuss list.

Acknowledgements

been possible:
